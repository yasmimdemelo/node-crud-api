# Node CRUD API 
This is a project of a CRUD API using Node.js to create an HTTP server that can handle incoming requests to create, read, update or delete data, through the Thunder Client.
This involves using built-in Node.js modules such as http, url, and fs to handle the server and routing logic, as well as a JSON file to allocate the data (simulating a database).

## Purpose for me ðŸŽ¯
Test a simple CRUD with Node.js and learn how it works without any libraries.
